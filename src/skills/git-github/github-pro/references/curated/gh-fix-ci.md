### From `gh-fix-ci-skill.md`

_Source topic: gh-fix-ci_

**Purpose:** Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks that run in GitHub Actions; use `gh` to inspect checks and logs, summarize failure context, draft a fix plan, and implement only after explicit approval. Treat external providers (for example Buildkite) as out of scope and report only the details URL.

# Gh Pr Checks Plan Fix

## Overview

Use gh to locate failing PR checks, fetch GitHub Actions logs for actionable failures, summarize the failure snippet, then propose a fix plan and implement after explicit approval.
- If a plan-oriented skill (for example `create-plan`) is available, use it; otherwise draft a concise plan inline and request approval before implementing.

Prereq: authenticate with the standard GitHub CLI once (for example, run `gh auth login`), then confirm with `gh auth status` (repo + workflow scopes are typically required).

## Inputs

- `repo`: path inside the repo (default `.`)
- `pr`: PR number or URL (optional; defaults to current branch PR)
- `gh` authentication for the repo host

## Quick start

- `python "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "<number-or-url>"`
- Add `--json` if you want machine-friendly output for summarization.

## Workflow

1. Verify gh authentication.
   - Run `gh auth status` in the repo.
   - If unauthenticated, ask the user to run `gh auth login` (ensuring repo + workflow scopes) before proceeding.
2. Resolve the PR.
   - Prefer the current branch PR: `gh pr view --json number,url`.
   - If the user provides a PR number or URL, use that directly.
3. Inspect failing checks (GitHub Actions only).
   - Preferred: run the bundled script (handles gh field drift and job-log fallbacks):
     - `python "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "<number-or-url>"`
     - Add `--json` for machine-friendly output.
   - Manual fallback:
     - `gh pr checks <pr> --json name,state,bucket,link,startedAt,completedAt,workflow`
       - If a field is rejected, rerun with the available fields reported by `gh`.
     - For each failing check, extract the run id from `detailsUrl` and run:
