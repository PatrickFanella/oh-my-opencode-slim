description: Manage long-term fate and fortune across a shared world. Use when powerful entities feel permanent, when the world becomes static, when you need probabilistic death/fall mechanics, or when campaigns need world-level consequences that persist. Operates above the game-facilitator level.

# World-Fates

Manage long-term destiny of characters/factions/locations so world keeps moving.

## Purpose

Turn static power into dynamic consequence with transparent probability + human approval gate.

## When to Use

- Powerful entities never fall
- Campaign world feels frozen
- You need probabilistic decline/death rules
- You want persistent world-level consequence tracking

## When Not to Use

- Single-scene stakes only (use scene-level skills)
- You need deterministic scripted outcomes only

## Workflow

1. **Assess entity state** (F1–F5)
   - F1 stable ascent
   - F2 peak power
   - F3 overextension
   - F4 precarious
   - F5 fall in progress
2. **Calculate fate pressure** using formula inputs
3. **Apply three-tier exit model**
   - Tier 1 voluntary NPC transition
   - Tier 2 fate-offered choice
   - Tier 3 fate-forced roll (last resort)
4. **Generate proposal** with roll/severity/consequences/alternatives
5. **Require human approval** before world-bible application

## Output Checklist

- [ ] Pressure inputs recorded (power, tenure, vulnerability, protection, fortune, exposure)
- [ ] Current state assigned (F1–F5)
- [ ] Tier path selected (1/2/3) with rationale
- [ ] Fate roll + severity captured when applicable
- [ ] Proposal includes consequences + alternatives
- [ ] Changes marked Proposed pending approval

## Guardrails

- Never apply shifts without human approval
- Never introduce death risk without pressure + danger + depleted fortune
- Same rules for protagonists and NPCs
- No pressure from nowhere; trace to events/choices
