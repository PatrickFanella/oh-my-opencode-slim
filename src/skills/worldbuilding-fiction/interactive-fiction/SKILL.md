# Interactive Fiction

Diagnose branching-narrative failures. Keep agency meaningful without losing authored coherence.

## Purpose

Balance player choice + narrative craft in designed possibility space.

## When to Use

- Choices feel fake or irrelevant
- Branches exploding in scope
- Story reads like flowchart/menu
- Endings unsatisfying or over-ranked
- State tracking collapsing

## When Not to Use

- You need full prose writing of branches (not this skill)
- You only need single linear plot diagnosis

## Workflow

1. **Identify IF failure state**
   - IF1 meaningless choices
   - IF2 unmanageable branching
   - IF3 false-choice trust break
   - IF4 agency vs authorship conflict
   - IF5 flowchart feel
   - IF6 ending dissatisfaction
   - IF7 state-management chaos
2. **Identify IF format**
   - parser / choice-based / hybrid / tabletop
3. **Run meaningful-choice test** on key choices
   - distinct options
   - perceivable consequences
   - irreversibility
   - character expression
4. **Apply structure intervention**
   - foldback, bottleneck, delayed consequences, constrained agency
5. **Simplify and validate state model**

## Output Checklist

- [ ] Problem state(s) identified (IF1–IF7)
- [ ] IF format identified
- [ ] Choice quality audited with meaningful-choice test
- [ ] Branching structure recommendation provided
- [ ] State model reduced to essential variables
- [ ] Ending model checked for value-validity (not single “best”)

## Guardrails

- Don’t offer choices that cannot matter
- Don’t promise infinite agency
- Don’t rank endings into one canonical “correct” path unless explicitly desired
- Don’t track state without visible consequence

## Integration / Handoffs

- `scene-sequencing` for branch scene craft
- `character-arc` for transformation consistency across paths
- `dialogue` for player-choice expression/subtext quality
