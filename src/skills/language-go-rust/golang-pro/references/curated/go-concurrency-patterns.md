# Go Concurrency Patterns

Curated from a previously merged skill. This file keeps the useful task guidance without preserving the old skill as an active nested skill.

## Guidance

### From `go-concurrency-patterns-skill.md`

_Source topic: go-concurrency-patterns_

**Purpose:** Master Go concurrency with goroutines, channels, sync primitives, and context. Use when building concurrent Go applications, implementing worker pools, or debugging race conditions.

# Go Concurrency Patterns

Production patterns for Go concurrency including goroutines, channels, synchronization primitives, and context management.

## When to Use This Skill

- Building concurrent Go applications
- Implementing worker pools and pipelines
- Managing goroutine lifecycles
- Using channels for communication
- Debugging race conditions
- Implementing graceful shutdown

## Core Concepts

### 1. Go Concurrency Primitives

| Primitive         | Purpose                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `goroutine`       | Lightweight concurrent execution |
| `channel`         | Communication between goroutines |
| `select`          | Multiplex channel operations     |
| `sync.Mutex`      | Mutual exclusion                 |
| `sync.WaitGroup`  | Wait for goroutines to complete  |
| `context.Context` | Cancellation and deadlines       |

### 2. Go Concurrency Mantra

```
Don't communicate by sharing memory;
share memory by communicating.
```

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    results := make(chan string, 10)
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    // Spawn workers
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
...
```

## Patterns
...

# Run with race detector
go run -race main.go
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Use context** - For cancellation and deadlines
- **Close channels** - From sender side only
- **Use errgroup** - For concurrent operations with errors
- **Buffer channels** - When you know the count
- **Prefer channels** - Over mutexes when possible

### Don'ts

- **Don't leak goroutines** - Always have exit path
- **Don't close from receiver** - Causes panic
- **Don't use shared memory** - Unless necessary
- **Don't ignore context cancellation** - Check ctx.Done()
- **Don't use time.Sleep for sync** - Use proper primitives
